# CrimeTrack
Online Crime Reporting System is a web-based program developed using PHP and MySQL. The purpose of the Crime Reporting System is to create a web-based application where people can report crime online. Provides the ability to upload photos or videos of crime scenes so that the police can take immediate action.

# Goal
The purpose of the Crime Reporting System is to create a web-based application where people can report crime online. Provides the ability to upload photos or videos of crime scenes so that the police can take immediate action. It also provides information on lost and wanted criminals as well as safety tips to educate people.


# Existing system
There is currently no web site available online for reporting crime online. To report any crime-related complaint, people should contact the nearest police station. People in a particular city do not know about crime related things like the list of most wanted criminals in their city, the latest crime stories, missing people in their area etc. and people should watch the news media or read the newspaper to get such information related to crime. We can therefore say that the current system works manually and does not provide all the information from a single source.
